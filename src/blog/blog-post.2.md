# Insertion Sort Algorithm

Insertion sort is a sorting algorithm that places an unsorted element at its suitable place in each iteration.

Insertion sort works similarly as we sort cards in our hand in a card game.

We assume that the first card is already sorted then, we select an unsorted card. If the unsorted card is greater than the card in hand, it is placed on the right otherwise, to the left. In the same way, other unsorted cards are taken and put at their right place.

A similar approach is used by insertion sort.

## pseudo code

insertionSort(array)
  mark first element as sorted
  for each unsorted element X
    'extract' the element X
    for j <- lastSortedIndex down to 0
      if current element j > X
        move sorted element to the right by 1
    break loop and insert X here
end insertionSort

## Implematation 

def insertionSort(array):

    for step in range(1, len(array)):
        key = array[step]
        j = step - 1
        
        # Compare key with each element on the left of it until an element smaller than it is found
        # For descending order, change key<array[j] to key>array[j].        
        while j >= 0 and key < array[j]:
            array[j + 1] = array[j]
            j = j - 1
        
        # Place key at after the element just smaller than it.
        array[j + 1] = key


data = [(insert array here)]
insertionSort(data)
print('Sorted Array in Ascending Order:')
print(data)

# Time Complexities

## Worst Case Complexity: O(n2)
Suppose, an array is in ascending order, and you want to sort it in descending order. In this case, worst case complexity occurs.

Each element has to be compared with each of the other elements so, for every nth element, (n-1) number of comparisons are made.

Thus, the total number of comparisons = n*(n-1) ~ n2
## Best Case Complexity: O(n)
When the array is already sorted, the outer loop runs for n number of times whereas the inner loop does not run at all. So, there are only n number of comparisons. Thus, complexity is linear.
## Average Case Complexity: O(n2)
It occurs when the elements of an array are in jumbled order (neither ascending nor descending).
Space Complexity

### Space complexity is O(1) because an extra variable key is used.

# Insertion Sort Applications
The insertion sort is used when:

-  the array is has a small number of elements
- there are only a few elements left to be sorted
